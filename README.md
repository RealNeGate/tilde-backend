# TildeBackend (Tilde or TB for short)

TB is compiler backend in the form of a reasonable C library. This is built as an alternative to other larger compiler toolchains while providing the optimizations, machine code generation and object file export functionality necessary for the development of compilers.

## Getting Started



## Compiling

Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/RealNeGate/tilde-backend.git` <br>
Then just compile & run the compile.c with the C11+ compiler (yes, MSVC counts) of your choice <br>
You should now have either a tildebackend.lib or tildebackend.a depending on the platform <br>
Copy this and the `tb.h` file into your project and use it as you please <br>
