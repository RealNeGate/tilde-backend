# TildeBackend (Tilde or TB for short)

TB is compiler backend in the form of a reasonable C library. This is built as an alternative to other larger compiler toolchains while providing the optimizations, machine code generation and object file export functionality necessary for the development of compilers.

## Getting Started



## Compiling

```
git clone https://github.com/RealNeGate/tilde-backend.git
python build.py
```
if you wish to compile with optimizations use `--opt` on the python args
