# Void

void type is a null-type which cannot hold data.

# Boolean

booleans represent either true or false and the conversion is defined as:

		((x != 0) ? true : false) where x is a data-holding type

this is important to note because in float types NaN comparisons always return
false which means that NaN is considered false in a (NaN -> bool) conversion.

# Integers

integer types come in a few basic sizes (i8, i16, i32, i64) and represent numerical
data and raw data. Integer operations can come in two forms: signed and unsigned.

# Floats

floating point types are IEEE-754 compliant 

# Pointers
